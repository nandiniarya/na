    "INSIGHTS \n",
    "\n",
    "1.Italy stands out with the highest sales, indicating a significant market share. This suggests a strong presence of customers or potential market demand in Italy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.The USA and Canada are next in line for sales, indicating a substantial customer base in North America. These countries contribute significantly to the overall sales distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.The majority of customers prefer cash transactions. This insight highlights the significance of cash as a preferred payment method, possibly due to customer preferences or cultural factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Credit cards are the second most popular payment method. This suggests a level of trust in electronic payment systems and may indicate a tech-savvy or financially secure customer base.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.This is the most important takeaway from the graph. The lines for all four protocols (TCP, ICMP, HTTP, and UDP) are trending upwards over time. This suggests that there is growing demand for network services, and that businesses are increasingly using all four protocols to meet their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.The TCP line is consistently the highest on the graph, which means that TCP is the most commonly used protocol for sales. This is likely because TCP is a reliable protocol that is well-suited for a variety of applications, such as file transfer and web browsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.The HTTP line is the steepest on the graph, which means that HTTP is the fastest-growing protocol for sales. This is likely because HTTP is the protocol that is used for web traffic, and the popularity of the web is growing rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.The median sales for females is higher than the median sales for males. This means that the middle 50% of female salespeople make more money than the middle 50% of male salespeople.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.The female box plot is wider than the male box plot. This means that there is a greater spread in the sales data for females than for males. In other words, there are a few female salespeople who make very high sales, and a few who make very low sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.There are data points that fall outside the whiskers of the box plots. These outliers represent salespeople who make much more or much less than the typical salesperson of their gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "11.The line graph shows a clear upward trend, suggesting that sales have been growing consistently over the period shown. This is a positive sign for the business, as it indicates that it is able to attract and retain customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "12.The line graph appears to be flattening out towards the end of the period shown. This could be a sign that the rate of sales growth is slowing down. However, it is also possible that this is just a temporary fluctuation and that sales will continue to grow in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "13.The line graph shows some small fluctuations up and down over time. These fluctuations could be due to seasonality, such as increased sales during the holiday season or decreased sales during the summer months. It is also possible that they are due to other factors, such as marketing campaigns or product launches.\n",
    "\n",
    "14.The line graph only shows sales data for a limited period of time. In order to understand the causes of the trends, it would be necessary to look at a longer period of data and to consider other factors such as marketing campaigns, product launches, and economic conditions.\n"
